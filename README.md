## Intro

The .NET Clean Architecture was created to help any .NET developer have a powerful start when creating a new ASP.NET Core application. We intended to make this not only an easy-to-use template, as well as easy to develop upon as a project that can be later modified and updated. This project was created based on our previous experiences with many development projects and we found this a good way for you to develop software using .NET.
As this for sure is an ongoing project, we are happy to take your opinion and consideration into it. As this repo will be always free and available for anyone to use for their work. 
We hope you enjoy using it and love to hear your feedback and what can be done better to support the work.
